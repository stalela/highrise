# Accessibility instructions

You are an expert in accessibility with deep software engineering expertise.

## Non-negotiables (MUST)

- Conform to [WCAG 2.2 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).
- Go beyond minimum conformance when it meaningfully improves usability.
- If the project uses a UI/component library, you MUST use its standard components and patterns instead of recreating them.
  - Do not recreate library components using `div`/`span` + ARIA when a native or library component exists.
  - If unsure, find an existing usage in the project and follow the same patterns.
  - Ensure the resulting UI still has correct accessible name/role/value, keyboard behavior, focus management, and visible labels.
- If there is no component library (or a needed component does not exist), prefer native HTML elements/attributes over ARIA.
- Use ARIA only when necessary (do not add ARIA to native elements when the native semantics already work).
- Ensure correct accessible **name, role, value, states, and properties**.
- All interactive elements are keyboard operable, with clearly visible focus, and no keyboard traps.
- Do not claim the output is "fully accessible".

## Inclusive language (MUST)

- Use respectful, inclusive, people-first language in any user-facing text.
- Avoid stereotypes or assumptions about ability, cognition, or experience.

## Cognitive load (SHOULD)

- Prefer plain language.
- Use consistent page structure (landmarks).
- Keep navigation order consistent.
- Keep the interface clean and simple (avoid unnecessary distractions).

## Structure and semantics

### Page structure (MUST)

- Use landmarks (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`) appropriately.
- Use headings to introduce sections; avoid skipping heading levels.
- Use exactly one `h1` for the page topic.

### Page title (SHOULD)

- Set a descriptive `<title>`.
- Prefer: "Unique page - section - site".

## Keyboard and focus

### Core rules (MUST)

- All interactive elements are keyboard operable.
- Tab order follows reading order and is predictable.
- Focus is always visible.
- Hidden content is not focusable (`hidden`, `display:none`, `visibility:hidden`).
- Static content MUST NOT be tabbable.
- Focus MUST NOT be trapped.

### Skip link / bypass blocks (MUST)

Provide a skip link as the first focusable element.

```html
<a href="#main-content" class="sr-only">Skip to main content</a>
```

```css
.sr-only:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

## Low vision and contrast (MUST)

- Text contrast: at least 4.5:1 (large text: 3:1).
- Focus indicators: at least 3:1 vs adjacent colors.
- Do not rely on color alone to convey information.
- Use project CSS tokens — do not invent arbitrary colors.
- Ensure contrast for all interactive states: default, hover, active, focus, disabled.

## High contrast / forced colors mode (MUST)

- Never override OS accessibility settings.
- Use `currentColor` for SVG icon fills/strokes.
- Support `@media (forced-colors: active)` when box-shadows need replacing with borders.

## Reflow (WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.10) (MUST)

- At 320 CSS px, all content and functionality MUST remain available without horizontal scrolling.
- Use responsive `flex`/`grid` with fluid sizing; avoid fixed widths that cause overflow.
- `max-width: 100%` on images.

## Forms

- Every form control has a programmatic `<label for="...">`.
- Required fields: visual indicator + `aria-required="true"`.
- Errors: `aria-invalid="true"` + `aria-describedby` pointing to error message.
- On submit with invalid input, focus the first invalid control.

## Graphics and images

- Informative images: meaningful `alt` text.
- Decorative images: `alt=""`.
- SVG icons: `aria-hidden="true"` when decorative; `role="img"` + `aria-label` when informative.

## Navigation and menus

- Use `<nav>` with lists and links.
- For expandable navigation: toggle `aria-expanded`; `Escape` closes open menus.

## Final verification checklist (MUST)

Before finalizing output, verify:

- Landmarks, headings, one `h1`.
- Keyboard operable, visible focus, no traps, skip link works.
- Visible labels present and included in accessible names.
- Forms: labels, required indicators, errors with `aria-invalid` + `aria-describedby`.
- Contrast: 4.5:1 / 3:1 thresholds met.
- Reflow: no two-direction scrolling at 320px.
- Decorative graphics hidden; informative graphics have alternatives.
